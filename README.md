This project was created in order to implement my knowledge in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) by consuming the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu/#api-endpoints-code).

Deployment performed in [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

see the result in the following link -> [Countries List](https://countrieslist.netlify.app)

It is a very simple system in which any person can obtain detailed information of countries.

Its use is very simple, when entering the home page you must choose some option of the `select` element and depending on the option an `input or select` will be activated that will play the role of search filters.

You can filter by Region, Capital, Language, Country, Call Code;

The result of these filters will bring us the flag of that Country, we only have to click on it and it will redirect us to a new screen with all the specifications.

**Obs**: In the details screen, the flag of the neighboring countries will appear, you can also click on it to go to a new screen with the respective information.
